# Getting Started with OpenAD

## Tl;dr

Get started in your terminal:

```shell
openad
```

Get started with Jupyter Notebook examples:

```shell
init_magic
```
```shell
init_examples
```
```shell
jupyter lab ~/openad_notebooks/Table_of_Contents.ipynb
```

!!! warning

    If you get an error when running `init_magic`, you may first need to setup the default iPython profile for magic commands.

    ```shell
    ipython profile create
    ```

## Getting Started - CLI

-   **Enter the virtual environment**

    ```shell
    source ~/ad-venv/bin/activate
    ```

-   **Enter the command shell**

    Here you'll find further instructions on how to use OpenAD.

    ```shell
    openad
    ```

    </p>

-   **Exit the command shell**<br>
    Hit `ctrl+c` or run:

    ```shell
    exit
    ```

-   **Run a single command from outside the command shell**

    ```shell
    openad <command>
    ```

-   **Exit the virtual environment**<br>

    ```shell
    deactivate
    ```

-   **Running Bash Commands**

    To run a command in bash mode, prepend it with `openad` and make sure to escape quotes.

    ```shell
    openad show molecules using file \'base_molecules.sdf\'
    ```

## Getting Started - Jupyter

### Setting up Jupyter

The following commands only need to be run once after installation:

<div class="padded-list-next"></div>

1.  **Activate your virtual environment**

    ```shell
    source ~/ad-venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Create an iPython kernel**<br>
    This ports your virtual environment to Jupyter.

    ```shell
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ad-venv
    ```

    > **Note:** List your installed iPython kernels: `jupyter kernelspec list`  
    > Remove a kernel: `jupyter kernelspec uninstall ad-venv`

3.  **Install the magic commands**<br>
    This enables OpenAD commands to be run within a Jupyter Notebook.

    ```shell
    init_magic
    ```

    <details>
    <summary><b>Alternative:</b> Manually add magic commands</summary>
    <div markdown>

    If you don't want to activate magic commands in all Notebooks, you can instead activate them for individual Notebooks.

    <div class="tight-list-next"></div>

    -   Run `init_examples`
    -   Copy the file `~/openad_notebooks/openad.ipynb` to the same directory as the Notebook you wish to activate.
    -   In your Notebook, run this inside a code cell: `!run openad.ipynb`

    </div>
    </details>

4.  **Install example Notebooks**<br>
    This installs our example Notebooks at `~/openad_notebooks`.

    ```shell
    init_examples
    ```

<br>

### Launching OpenAD in Jupyter

1.  **Open any Notebook**<br>
    Launch Jupyter lab to create a fresh notebook, or get started with our example Notebook:
    
    ```shell
    jupyter lab
    ```
    ```shell
    jupyter lab ~/openad_notebooks/Table_of_Contents.ipynb
    ```

2.  **Select the kernel**<br>
    Make sure to select the "ad-venv" iPython kernel you just created. You can do this under _Kernel > Change Kernel_, or by clicking the kernel name in the top right hand corner. If you don't see your iPython kernel, make sure you followed the Jupyter Setup instructions listed above.

3.  **Magic Commands**<br>
    Magic commands let you access any OpenAD CLI command from within Jupyter. They are invoked by the `%openad` prefix. Try listing your files as a test:

    ```python
    %openad list files
    ```

    If you wish to retrieve data from an OpenAD command, you can use the `%openadd` prefix instead. This will return raw, unstyled data for further processing. For example:

    ```python
    my_data = %openadd display data 'my_data_file.csv'

    for item in my_data:
        print(item.smiles)
    ```

    To see the available commands, you consult the [Commands](commands.md) page, or you can request inline help:

    ```python
    %openad ?
    ```
