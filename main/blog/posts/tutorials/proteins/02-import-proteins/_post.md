# How to Import Proteins from the Protein Data Bank

Learn how to use OpenAD to easily import protein data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank using a protein's PDB ID or FASTA string.

## Importing a Protein

First we visualize a protein, either by its PDB id, or by searching for a FASTA string:

```shell
show protein '9J4J'
```

```shell
show protein 'MSLNRHFTVSVFIVCKDKVLLHLHKKAKKMLPLGGHIEVNELPEEACIREAKEEAGLNVTLYNPIDINLKKSCDLSGEKLLINPIHTILGDVSPNHSHIDFVYYATTTSFETSPEIGESKILKWYSKEDLKNAHNIQENILVMATEALDLLEGHHHHHH'
```

This will open the protein in the macromolecule viewer, from where you can save it to your workspace.
