# Generate Documentation

This script generates and updates a number of markdown pages for the documentation website, as well as some files for the [openad-toolkit] repository, ensuring consistency across all documentation.

### How to regenerate documentation

Generate files &rarr; save to [_output](_output):

```
python3 generator/generate_docs.py
```

Distribute files to final destination (with confirmation step):

```
python3 generator/update_docs.py
```

All at once:

```
python3 generator/generate_docs.py --update
```

### How it works

-   The `/source` folder is the "single source of truth" and contains a number of text files with descriptions for OpenAD and some of its core concepts, as well as the list of model services.
-   The `/_templates` folder contains the markdown templates that are used to generate some of the markdown pages for the [openad-docs] repository.
-   The `/output` folder is where all files are stored before they're distributed to their final destination
